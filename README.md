It's finally summer, let's enjoy ourselves at the beach and taste a variety of juicy fruits in this wonderful season.
This game is inspired by the famous Candy Crush Saga 🍬🍭🍫

## 📱How to play
- Use your mouse 🖱️to swap 2 adjacent items in the board

If you create a horizontal triple of fruits or a vertical one, they will disappear.

Similarly, a vertical quadruple will result in a pair of flipflops. ![quad_vert](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121799496/232235680-2a60cb12-4f5a-48f2-8756-230619c102fb.png)

- The starfish will stick to all the fruits similar to the adjacent one that you choose and make them all disappear (make sure to click the starfish first)
- Clicking on a glass of juice will make all the fruits in a row disappear, except for the starfish. If there is a pair of flipflops in that row, it will be in use and make a column of fruits disappear
- Combining a starfish with juice or flipflops activates all special items at once.
- You only have a certain number of moves to accumulate points. You will win if your score is equal to or greater than the target.
